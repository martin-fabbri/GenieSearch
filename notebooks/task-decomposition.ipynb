JSON numbers must not include exponential notation, such as 1.2e-45.\\n* A boolean represents one of two values, true or false.\\n* An object is an unordered collection of name/value pairs where the names are strings and the values are JSON data types. Objects are delimited with curly brackets {}.\\n* An array is an ordered collection of zero or more JSON data types, each of which may be any valid JSON data type. Arrays are delimited with square brackets [].\\n* null represents the absence of a value.\\n\\nJSON data format also supports whitespace characters, and it requires UTF-8 encoding.\\n\\nJSON limitations and alternatives:\\n\\n* JSON lacks support for comments which makes it unsuitable for configuration files. JSON5 is a variant that supports comments and other features.\\n* JSON does not have built-in support for dates or more advanced data types, but conventions can be used to serialize them. BSON is a binary format that stores JSON documents in a more compact and efficient way.\\n* JSON is verbose due to the required double quotes around all keys and strings and also because it is a text-based format.\\n\\nJSON is widely used for data interchange between web services, databases, and other systems, and it is supported by most modern programming languages. It can be stored in plain text files with .json extension and can be opened using any plain text editor or JSON Editor Online. JSON is simpler and more compact than XML, but XML can be used when dealing with a legacy system that only supports XML or when there are very specific constraints.\\n\\n JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format that is both human- and machine-readable. It is based on JavaScript but supported by many programming languages. JSON uses a compact text format to store and transfer data, using less text and requiring less data to store and transfer compared to XML. A JSON object contains attribute/value pairs separated by commas within curly brackets, where an attribute name and its value are separated by a colon. For example, a book can be defined in JSON as {\"book\":{\"title\":\"A Study in Scarlet\", \"author\":\"Arthur Conan Doyle\", \"publisher\":{\"name\":\"Ward Lock & Co\",\"year\":\"1887\",\"country\":\"United Kingdom\"}}}.\\n\\n JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. It is based on a subset of the JavaScript Programming Language, Standard ECMA-262 3rd Edition - December 1999. JSON is a text format that is completely language independent but uses conventions that are familiar to programmers of the C-family of languages, including C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, Python, and many others. These properties make JSON an ideal data interchange language.\\n\\nJSON consists of two structures:\\n\\n* A collection of name/value pairs. In various languages, this is realized as an object, record, struct, dictionary, hash table, keyed list, or associative array.\\n* An ordered list of values. In most languages, this is realized as an array, vector, list, or sequence.\\n\\nA JSON document is a plain text file containing a JSON document. Normally, these files have the extension .json and can be opened with any plain text editor or opened in JSON Editor Online.\\n\\nJSON has some limitations such as lack of support for comments, dates, and other more advanced data types. However, it is still widely popular due to its simplicity and support in all programming languages. JSON is a subset of JavaScript but is not a programming language itself. It can be used inside applications like JavaScript browser application and backend server application.\\n\\nJSON data is usually stored in a variable or constant and can be parsed into an object or stringified again using the built-in functions provided by most programming languages. JSON format is often used for configuration files, data storage, and data interchange between servers and web applications.\\n\\n The provided text does not contain information on the topic \"JSON format explained\". I cannot answer this question without additional context or information.\\n\\n JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a widely used data format for data interchange on the web. It is human-readable as well as machine-readable. JSON was created by Douglas Crockford in 2001 and standardized under RFC 4627 through the IETF in 2006, and later standardized by Ecma International under ECMA 404 in 2013. The standard file type for storing a JSON document is .json and its Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) media (or MIME) type is application/json. A JSON document can contain two structures: an object surrounded by curly braces containing multiple name/value pairs, or an array surrounded by square brackets.\\n\\nHere\\'s an example of a JSON document:\\n```\\n{\\n\\t\"employee\": {\\n\\t\\t\"id\": 1,\\n\\t\\t\"name\": \"Admin\",\\n\\t\\t\"location\": \"USA\"\\n\\t}\\n}\\n```\\nThis tutorial covers various concepts about JSON including the difference between JSON and XML, JSON syntax, how to read and write JSON documents, converting JSON to string and vice-versa, etc.\\n\\n JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. It is often used when data is sent from a server to a web page. A JSON object looks something like this:\\n```\\n{\\n  \"name\": \"John Smith\",\\n  \"age\": 30,\\n  \"city\": \"New York\"\\n}\\n```\\nPython dictionaries are similar to JSON objects in that they are collections of key-value pairs. However, there are some differences between the two. For example:\\n\\n* In Python, dictionary keys must be immutable types such as strings or numbers, whereas in JSON, keys can be any string.\\n* In Python, dictionaries use colon (:) to separate keys and values, whereas in JSON, keys and values are separated by a colon and surrounded by quotes.\\n* In Python, dictionaries are enclosed in curly braces {}, whereas in JSON, objects are also enclosed in curly braces.\\n\\nHere is an example of how the above JSON object would look as a Python dictionary:\\n```\\n{\\'name\\': \\'John Smith\\', \\'age\\': 30, \\'city\\': \\'New York\\'}\\n```\\nTo convert between JSON and Python dictionaries, you can use the `json.loads()` and `json.dumps()` functions from the `json` module in Python. For example:\\n```\\nimport json\\n\\njson_string = \\'{\"name\": \"John Smith\", \"age\": 30, \"city\": \"New York\"}\\'\\npython_dict = json.loads(json_string)\\n\\n# Output: {\\'name\\': \\'John Smith\\', \\'age\\': 30, \\'city\\': \\'New York\\'}\\nprint(python_dict)\\n\\njson_string = json.dumps(python_dict)\\n\\n# Output: {\"name\": \"John Smith\", \"age\": 30, \"city\": \"New York\"}\\nprint(json_string)\\n```\\n\\n JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. It is based on a subset of the JavaScript Programming Language, Standard ECMA-262 3rd Edition - December 1999. JSON is a text format that is completely language independent but uses conventions that are familiar to programmers of the C-family of languages, including C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, Python, and many others. These properties make JSON an ideal data interchange language.\\n\\nPython dictionaries are a part of core Python and serve as a primitive datatype in the language. They were introduced in Python version 0.992 and have since remained an essential piece of Python\\'s object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigm. Dictionaries are a collection of key-value pairs and are mutable, meaning they can be changed after creation.\\n\\nHere are some differences between JSON and Python dictionaries:\\n\\n1. JSON is a string, while a Python dictionary is an object with keys and values. To convert a JSON string to a dictionary, you can use the json.loads() method in Python.\\n2. A Python dictionary can have complex data types as values (lists, other dictionaries), while JSON only supports simple data types like strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and another object (JSON object).\\n3. JSON is case-sensitive when it comes to keys, while Python dictionary keys are case-sensitive by default but can be configured to be case-insensitive.\\n4. In JSON, the key must be a string, while in Python, the key can be any immutable data type (string, number, tuple).\\n5. JSON does not support comments, while Python dictionaries do not have this restriction.\\n6. JSON is a standard data format with a well-defined specification, while Python dictionaries are a part of the core language and may change between versions.\\n7. JSON is a text format that can be used to transfer data over a network or store data in a file, while Python dictionaries are an in-memory data structure.\\n8. JSON keys must be strings enclosed in double quotes, but Python dictionary keys can be any valid string.\\n9. In Python, dictionary values are accessed using square brackets [] and the key, while in JSON, array elements are accessed using square brackets [] and the index.\\n10. Python dictionaries have built-in functions like len(), clear(), get(), update(), pop(), etc., but JSON does not have any built-in functions.\\n\\n The text does not provide information on the differences between JSON and Python dictionaries. However, I can provide a summary of the key differences between the two:\\n\\n1. Data Types: JSON only supports string, number, boolean, array, object and null data types while Python dictionary has more built-in data types such as integers, float, list, tuple, and dict.\\n2. Nested Objects: Both JSON and Python dictionaries support nested objects but JSON requires the use of double quotes for keys while Python uses single or double quotes interchangeably.\\n3. Mutability: JSON is immutable (i.e., it cannot be modified once created) while Python dictionary is mutable.\\n4. Ordering: JSON objects do not maintain the order of keys while Python dictionaries maintain the order in which keys were inserted.\\n5. Whitespaces: JSON does not allow the use of whitespaces in keys while Python dictionary allows it.\\n6. Comments: JSON does not support comments while Python dictionary allows single-line and multi-line comments.\\n7. Data Serialization/Deserialization: JSON data needs to be serialized/deserialized using libraries like json, simplejson or marshal in Python. However, Python dictionaries can be directly used for serialization/deserialization with pickle library.\\n8. Performance: JSON parsing is faster than Python dictionary creation due to the built-in support for JSON in many programming languages.\\n9. File Format: JSON files have .json extension while Python dictionary files do not have a specific file format and are usually stored as .py or .pickle files.'"
